# ClipZoomFx #
Side-project for extracting highlights from videos. It started as way to capture exceptional 
plays from volleyball matches I've recorded. This may use high 
quality video footage that accessible by the computer it is running
on.

ClipZoomFx manages a library of video files that can be played
back in the application. "Highlight-able" portions (clips) can be designated with start and stop 
points designated by a range slider. Clips can also be zoomed in using the mouse wheel. 

A highlight reel can be generated by selecting clips and having them concatenated using a library that uses ffmpeg.

The ability to generate clips that have been zoomed in on along with the fact that it uses JavaFx gives it the name ClipZoomFx
(I didn't spend that much time thinking about the name ;))
